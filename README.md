## Welcome to Luke Barratt's GitHub

Hi, I am a PhD student in Statistics based in the Statistical Laboratory in the Department for Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics of the University of Cambridge. I am a member of Trinity College, Cambridge. I research functional and spatial statistical approaches to official data with a view towards public policy questions, under the supervision of Professor Sir John Aston, former Chief Scientific Advisor at the UK's Home Office.

My current research interests include:
 - spatially referenced functional data
 - phase registration of time series
 - dynamic spatiotemporal and functional modelling
 - Covid infection and death analysis
